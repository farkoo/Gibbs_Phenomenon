# Gibbs_Phenomenon

Gibb’s Phenomenon in Digital Filter’s refer to the manner how a Fourier series of periodic functions behave near jump discontinuation, the partial sum of the Fourier series has large oscillations near the discontinuation, which might increase the maximum of the partial sum above that of the function itself. Thus, there is an overshoot as the terms are getting added of the Fourier series at the discontinuity.
